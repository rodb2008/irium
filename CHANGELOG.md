# Changelog

All notable changes to Irium are documented in this file.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- OTC agreement direction: `build_otc_agreement` now wires `payer = seller_id` and `payee = buyer_id`, with `refund_address = seller.address` and `release_authorizer = "seller"`. The seller funds the on-chain HTLC escrow; the buyer pays off-chain and receives IRM on release; the seller reclaims via the timeout refund path if no release happens. This corrects a long-standing inversion in the builder where the buyer was placed in the payer slot, which contradicted the actual flow and `docs/SETTLEMENT-DEV.md`.
- iriumd `/rpc/agreementreleaseeligibility` and `/rpc/agreementrefundeligibility` (via `evaluate_agreement_spend_eligibility`) now hash the supplied secret preimage with single SHA256 to match the consensus HTLC script (`HTLC_V1_HASHALG_SHA256 = 1`) and `chain.rs`. Previously the advisory check used double SHA256 and falsely reported `secret_hash_mismatch` for valid preimages, blocking release.

### Changed

- `agreement-fund` (wallet) refuses OTC agreements whose payer party has role `"buyer"` (legacy direction) with a clear error message directing the user to create a new agreement. No on-chain HTLCs are affected; this is a wallet-side rejection only.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-01

This release documents everything built across Phases A–F of the Irium chain
upgrade and marks the first official tagged release of the codebase.

### Added

**Core chain**
- SHA-256d proof-of-work consensus — fully compatible with Bitcoin ASIC hardware and merged mining
- P2PKH address scheme with custom version byte; IRM addresses begin with `I`
- Block reward of 50 IRM per block, halving every 210,000 blocks; maximum supply 100,000,000 IRM
- 600-second target block interval, difficulty retarget every 2,016 blocks
- COINBASE_MATURITY of 100 blocks before coinbase outputs are spendable
- Genesis block locked and immutable in `configs/genesis-locked.json`
- LWMA (Linearly Weighted Moving Average) difficulty algorithm, window N=60, active from mainnet height 16,462
- LWMA v2 with reduced window (N=30) and larger solvetime clamp (10×T) for faster post-hashrate-collapse recovery, active from mainnet height 19,740
- HTLCv1 (Hash Time-Locked Contracts v1) active from mainnet height 18,677
- All activation heights configurable via environment variable overrides for testnet and devnet

**Settlement layer**
- Offer creation, listing, filtering, sorting, and ranked display via CLI and REST API
- Agreement formation: offer-take locks both parties into a verifiable on-chain agreement object
- Three built-in policy templates: basic OTC escrow, contractor milestone, preorder deposit
- Proof submission against active agreements with configurable policy evaluation
- Full agreement lifecycle: offer → agreement → funded → proof submitted → released or expired
- Agreement anchor outputs embedded in chain transactions for independent on-chain verifiability
- Agreement audit trail with full timestamped activity timeline and linked transaction references
- Timelock-enforced refund paths when agreements expire without a valid proof
- Settlement receipt export in plain text and HTML
- `POST /rpc/submitproof` — submit a proof against an active agreement
- `POST /rpc/sendtx` — broadcast a signed raw transaction
- `GET /api/offers` — list offers with filter and sort support
- `POST /api/offers` — create a new offer
- `POST /api/agreements` — take an offer and form an agreement
- `GET /api/agreements/:id` — query agreement status and full detail
- `POST /api/proofs` — submit a proof via REST
- `GET /offers/feed` — public unauthenticated offer feed for cross-node discovery

**Reputation system**
- Per-seller trust scoring derived entirely from on-chain agreement history
- Recency weighting: outcomes from the past 30 days carry more weight than older history
- Sybil resistance: new identities begin with a lower trust ceiling until outcome history accumulates
- Dispute rate, late-proof rate, and default tracking as explicit risk signals
- Reputation portability: scores follow the seller public key, not a centralised account
- `GET /api/reputation/:pubkey` — query reputation and risk signals for any public key
- Offer ranking score computed from seller reputation, surfaced in `offer-list` output

**P2P marketplace discovery**
- Multi-source offer feed aggregation: nodes pull, validate, and merge feeds from configured sources
- Feed registry commands: `feed-add`, `feed-remove`, `feed-list`, `feed-bootstrap`
- Feed validation: response size cap, malformed-entry rejection, health status output
- Feed pruning command to remove stale entries and reclaim space
- Peer-to-peer proof gossip: submitted proofs propagate to all connected nodes
- Proof templates for common escrow patterns with variable substitution
- Attestor discovery: nodes advertise willingness to act as third-party proof witnesses

**Wallet CLI (`irium-wallet`)**
- Key generation, import, and encrypted wallet store backup
- Balance and UTXO queries against a live node
- Transaction construction, signing, and broadcast
- Offer commands: `offer-create`, `offer-list`, `offer-show`, `offer-take`, `offer-export`
- Agreement commands: `agreement-pack`, `agreement-unpack`, `agreement-show`
- Proof commands: `proof-build`, `proof-submit`
- Reputation command: `reputation-show` with full risk signal breakdown
- Feed commands: `feed-add`, `feed-remove`, `feed-list`, `feed-fetch`, `feed-bootstrap`
- Policy commands: `policy-build-otc`, `raw-policy`
- Guided OTC demo flow: `flow-otc-demo`
- Settlement receipt export: `receipt-export` outputs text and HTML
- Phase 4 Rust integration layer: wallet reads UTXO set and broadcasts directly against node state
- Human-readable timestamps on all agreement and proof outputs
- Next-step hints after each command guide users through the complete flow

**Miners**
- CPU miner (`irium-miner`) with configurable address, RPC endpoint, and thread count
- GPU miner (`irium-miner-gpu`) using OpenCL; enumerates available platforms and devices at startup
- GPU miner degrades gracefully to a clear error when no OpenCL platform is found (`--list-platforms`)
- Miner coinbase address validation: refuses to mine without a valid, funded payout address
- LWMA v2 activation-boundary detection in miner prevents stale `bits` mismatch at activation height

**Node daemon (`iriumd`)**
- Full node with persistent block storage and state recovery across restarts
- P2P peer discovery via signed seedlist in `bootstrap/seedlist.txt`
- Bootstrap trust framework: anchor signers verified against `bootstrap/trust/allowed_anchor_signers`
- Rate limiter on all RPC and P2P endpoints to resist abuse
- CORS headers on all HTTP endpoints for browser-based tooling
- TLS support via rustls with opt-in configuration
- Network era display on startup (currently: Early Miner Era)
- All ports and addresses configurable via environment variables — no hardcoded values in source

**SPV client (`irium-spv`)**
- Lightweight client for balance and transaction queries without downloading full block history

**Wallet API server (`irium-wallet-api`)**
- HTTP server exposing settlement, balance, and transaction endpoints for wallet front-ends

**Infrastructure**
- systemd unit files for `iriumd`, `irium-miner`, `irium-explorer`, `irium-wallet-api`
- Environment variable templates for all services in `systemd/*.env.example`
- Rust SDK stub in `sdk/` as the integration surface for third-party applications
- Business templates for invoice generation, seller status, and buyer status flows

### Fixed

- Late-proof vulnerability: proofs submitted after the agreement deadline are now rejected
- LWMA v2 boundary edge case in miner causing incorrect `bits` value on the activation block
- Offer ID path traversal: IDs validated to alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores only on both read and write paths
- Reputation pubkey resolution for 66-character compressed pubkeys (was silently returning no data)
- `offer-list` default sort order restored to newest-first after offer ranking refactor changed it
- `ring` CryptoProvider not being installed before TLS initialisation in `iriumd`
- HTTP RPC scheme defaulting to the wrong protocol in wallet CLI

### Security

- All source files audited and cleaned of hardcoded IP addresses and port numbers
- Miner coinbase address validation hardened; empty-script fallback removed entirely
- Offer ID write-path and read-path validation hardened against path traversal attacks
- Dependency update: `rustls-webpki` DoS vulnerability patched (Dependabot advisory)
- Cleartext session data logging removed from all log paths
- XSS vulnerability in explorer output sanitised
