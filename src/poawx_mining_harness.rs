//! Phase 24K/24L: Irium-native PoAW-X all-gates mining submit harness (helpers).
//!
//! Phase 24J proved the remaining blocker for a real all-gates block was mining
//! TOOLING, not PoAW-X consensus: stock cpuminer/minerd hashes a standard
//! Bitcoin 80-byte header with `sha256d`, but Irium hashes the block header via
//! [`crate::block::BlockHeader::hash_for_height`] (a height-bound serialization),
//! so minerd's shares never match Irium's PoW target. The fix is to mine with
//! Irium's ACTUAL PoW hash.
//!
//! This module provides the small, reusable, **mainnet-hard-off** primitives a
//! devnet/testnet harness (in-process tests and the explicit
//! `poawx-live-proof-harness` binary for the Phase 24L Windows live proof) needs
//! to produce a real all-gates block:
//!   * [`guard_network`] — refuse mainnet (`network_id == 0`); require an
//!     explicit devnet/testnet id.
//!   * [`guard_isolated_storage`] — refuse missing/default/`/tmp` runtime
//!     storage; require an explicit isolated dir that is NOT the production
//!     default (`$HOME/.irium` on Unix, `%USERPROFILE%\.irium` on Windows).
//!   * [`mine_pow`] — grind the header nonce using Irium's REAL PoW path. This
//!     NEVER touches LWMA / difficulty / target logic.
//!   * [`build_devnet_all_gates_block`] — assemble a complete all-gates block
//!     (admissions + candidate set + puzzle + finality + committed admission +
//!     true-VRF + canonical 0%-fee coinbase + mined PoW) from public APIs. Used
//!     by the live-proof binary AND validated end-to-end by a `connect_block`
//!     test (so the binary's exact construction is proven node-acceptable).
//!
//! Nothing here prints private keys, seeds, or VRF secrets. Harness keys are
//! deterministic test/dev keys; this is devnet/testnet-only (mainnet hard-off).
