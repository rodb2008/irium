**AuxPoW Merged Mining — Activating Height 26,347**

Irium implements Namecoin-compatible AuxPoW merged mining. The activation is hardcoded at block height 26,347, estimated around 12 June 2026.

After activation:
- Any SHA-256d pool mining Bitcoin can simultaneously mine IRM
- No hardware or firmware changes required for miners
- The pool embeds an Irium block commitment in the Bitcoin coinbase
- When a share meets the Irium difficulty, an AuxPoW block is submitted to the Irium network
- Miners earn IRM block rewards on top of their existing Bitcoin earnings

This is the same Namecoin-style merged mining that major SHA-256d pools have supported for over a decade. The Irium-specific details are documented at:
https://github.com/iriumlabs/irium/blob/main/docs/MERGED-MINING.md

**Hardware Compatibility**

Every SHA-256d ASIC works:
- Antminer S19 / S21
- Whatsminer M50 / M60
- All Bitmain and MicroBT hardware
- Any SHA-256d USB miner
- Software miners (cpuminer-opt, CGMiner, BFGMiner)

**Stratum Server (Included)**

The Irium repository includes a complete Stratum V1 server at `pool/irium-stratum`. It handles both standard solo mining today and AuxPoW merged mining after activation. No third-party pool software required.

```bash
cd irium/pool/irium-stratum
cargo build --release
export IRIUM_RPC_BASE=http://localhost:38300
export IRIUM_RPC_TOKEN=your_token
export STRATUM_BIND=0.0.0.0:3333
export IRIUM_AUXPOW_ACTIVATION_HEIGHT=26347
./target/release/irium-stratum
```

All settings are environment variables. No hardcoded addresses or ports.
