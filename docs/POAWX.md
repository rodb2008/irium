# PoAW-X — Irium Proposer Consensus

PoAW-X (Proof-of-Adaptive-Work, eXtended) is Irium's block-proposer consensus layer. It adds
verifiable, fairly distributed block proposal and multi-role rewards on top of Irium's existing
SHA-256d proof of work, without changing the underlying PoW or the LWMA-144 difficulty algorithm.

## Activation: mainnet block 50,000

PoAW-X activates on Irium **mainnet at block height 50,000**.

- **Before block 50,000:** blocks follow the existing SHA-256d PoW rules, unchanged.
- **At and after block 50,000:** every block must additionally satisfy the PoAW-X consensus rules
  described below.

The activation height is fixed in consensus code (`MAINNET_POAWX_ACTIVATION_HEIGHT = 50_000`); it
is **not** an operator setting and cannot be enabled or disabled by configuration.

> **Operators and miners must upgrade to iriumd v1.9.119 (or later) before block 50,000.** A node
> still running an older binary will reject post-activation blocks and fall off the canonical chain.

## What PoAW-X adds

1. **VRF proposer selection** — each block has a verifiably-selected proposer chosen by a Verifiable
   Random Function, not just whoever finds the proof of work first.
2. **Multi-role reward split** — the block reward is split across four contribution roles.
3. **Anti-domination** — per-identity weighting over a rolling 2016-block window discourages any
   single identity from dominating proposal.
4. **Distributed finality** — a registered committee provides 2/3-threshold finality votes.
5. **Consensus security gates** — hidden role-precommit, sybil tickets, committed admission,
   deterministic receipts, equivocation and lane-validation checks.

## Reward distribution (55 / 22 / 13 / 10)

From block 50,000, each block's coinbase splits the block reward across four roles:

| Role | Share |
|------|-------|
| Proposer (primary) | 55% |
| Compute | 22% |
| Verify | 13% |
| Support | 10% |

The split is materialized as four P2PKH coinbase outputs paying each role's address, plus an `irx1`
`OP_RETURN` commitment binding the block's role receipts. In solo mining, one identity fills all four
roles and receives the full reward; in collaborative mining the roles are paid to distinct
participants.

## VRF proposer system

- **Sortition.** For each height, an eligible proposer is selected by an ECVRF (RFC-9381) proof bound
  to a per-height seed. The proof (`AssignmentProofV2`) is verifiable by every node, so the selected
  proposer cannot be forged.
- **Registration.** To be eligible, a proposer registers a VRF public key on-chain. Registration
  carries a sybil-resistant proof of work and is **frozen** at a depth below the tip, so the
  per-height seed (revealed only at the previous block) cannot be used to register a winning key
  after the fact.
- **Seed.** The selection seed is derived from prior block data and finality signatures, so it is
  unpredictable before the parent block and deterministic afterward.

## Running a node

1. Install **iriumd v1.9.119** (or later) — see [QUICKSTART.md](../QUICKSTART.md) and
   [README.md](../README.md).
2. Run it as you would any Irium node. From block 50,000 it validates PoAW-X automatically — **no
   environment variables are required on mainnet**; the activation height and all consensus rules are
   built in.
3. Make sure you are upgraded **before** block 50,000.

## Mining

From block 50,000, **mining requires a full `iriumd` node** — a pool/stratum connection alone is no
longer sufficient to produce valid blocks, because each block must carry a verifiable proposer
assignment and role receipts that only a full node can build and validate.

- Run your full node (`iriumd`).
- Run the bundled miner against it with the PoAW-X flag:

  ```
  irium-miner --poawx
  ```

  The miner requests the current role assignment from your node, performs the role work, and submits
  role receipts; your node assembles and validates the block. See [MINING.md](MINING.md) for
  hardware-specific miner setup.

Pool operators must run a full node and move their workers to the full-node flow before block 50,000.

## Consensus security gates

At and after block 50,000, every block is validated against the full PoAW-X gate set (all of which
were validated in a 2016-block adversarial soak before activation):

- **Proposer VRF** — the block's proposer assignment proof must verify against the registered VRF key
  and per-height seed.
- **Hidden role-precommit** — each block commits the next block's role-claim leaves; claims must
  reveal pre-committed leaves matching the parent's `precommit_root`.
- **Sybil tickets** — role claims must carry tickets meeting the minimum sybil-work threshold.
- **Committed admission** — the committed admission root must match.
- **Multi-role reward split** — the coinbase must pay the 55/22/13/10 split to the correct role
  addresses.
- **Anti-domination** — per-identity weighting over the rolling 2016-block window.
- **Finality committee** — 2/3-threshold finality votes from distinct registered committee keys.
- **Audit hardening** — deterministic receipts root, equivocation and parent-hash checks, signature
  coverage, lane-byte validation, strict leaf decoding.

A block that fails any required gate at or after activation is rejected.
