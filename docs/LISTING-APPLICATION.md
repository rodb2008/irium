| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Terminal | ~1,930,000+ | ~0 | 100,000,000 IRM |

## Current Network State (as of May 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Chain height | 20,299 |
| Genesis hash | `0000000028f25d65557e9d8d9e991f516c00d68f5aeae10b750645b398bd10a3` |
| Network era | Early Miner Era |
| Block reward | 50 IRM (first era; no halvings yet) |
| Connected peers | 5 |
| Circulating supply | ~1,014,950 IRM (height x 50 IRM) |

## What Is Live Today

- Fully operational mainnet running continuously since genesis
- Proof-of-work consensus enforced, chain secured by real hashrate
- Wallet CLI (`irium-wallet`) for address generation, sending, and receiving
- Settlement layer: HTLC-based escrow with offer/agreement/proof lifecycle
- Marketplace: on-chain OTC offer feed and agreement execution
- Reputation system: on-chain outcome tracking per seller pubkey
- REST API on every node: balance queries, block/tx lookup, mempool, offer feed
- Public Stratum pool: `pool.iriumlabs.org:3333` (ASIC), `:3335` (CPU/GPU)
- Docker images: `ghcr.io/iriumlabs/irium:latest`
- Pre-built release binaries: Linux x86_64/ARM64, macOS Intel/ARM, Windows

## Upcoming: AuxPoW Merged Mining

AuxPoW merged mining activates at block height 26,347 (estimated 12 June 2026). After activation, any SHA-256d pool mining Bitcoin can simultaneously mine Irium at zero additional energy cost by embedding the Irium block commitment in the parent coinbase transaction.

The full AuxPoW implementation is in the current codebase. See `docs/MERGED-MINING.md` for technical details.

## What Is on the Roadmap

- Desktop/web/mobile wallet applications (separate development track)
- Additional community mining pools
- Hardware wallet integration (after BIP44 coin type registration)

## Security Statement

- No premine. The genesis block coinbase is unspendable (standard null input, miner address holds nothing).
- No admin keys. No entity can freeze accounts, reverse transactions, or modify the chain.
- No freeze capability. No transaction censorship mechanism exists in the codebase.
- Open source. Full source code at https://github.com/iriumlabs/irium under the MIT licence.
- No venture capital. No foundation with allocation. No token sale.

## Integration Resources

**REST API:** Every `iriumd` node exposes a complete HTTP API for balance queries, transaction submission, block lookup, and settlement operations. See `docs/API.md`.

**Wallet integration:** Custom deterministic key derivation (SHA256-based, non-BIP32). Address format: Base58Check with version byte `0x39`. See `docs/KEY-DERIVATION.md` for the full derivation specification.

**Transaction format:** Standard Bitcoin transaction serialisation (version, inputs, outputs, locktime). P2PKH locking scripts. SHA256d transaction IDs.

**Mining integration:** Standard Bitcoin getblocktemplate protocol via `GET /rpc/getblocktemplate`. Submit blocks via `POST /rpc/submit_block`. SHA-256d algorithm, standard 80-byte header. AuxPoW blocks additionally include `auxpow_hex` field.

**Merged mining:** AuxPoW activates at height 26,347. Commitment magic: `0xfa 0xbe 0x6d 0x6d`. Version bit: `1 << 8`. Full protocol documented in `docs/MERGED-MINING.md`.
