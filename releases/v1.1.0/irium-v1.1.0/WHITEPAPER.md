## Abstract

Irium is a purpose-built proof-of-work blockchain designed to maximize network independence and long-term survivability. The protocol eliminates reliance on DNS infrastructure, enforces transparent founder vesting via on-chain timelocks, incentivizes transaction relay quality without inflation, and prioritizes light client usability from genesis. This whitepaper outlines the core design principles, system architecture, monetary policy, and implementation status of the IRM asset and its supporting network.

**Current Implementation:** Production mainnet is LIVE with all 8 core innovations operational.

---

## 1. Introduction

Most established proof-of-work networks inherit architectural assumptions from Bitcoin, including DNS-based bootstrapping, addrman-driven peer discovery, and an absence of protocol-level incentives for fast relay. Irium rethinks these components to produce a mainnet that can launch and sustain itself even if all founding infrastructure disappears.

**Irium launched on October 16, 2025 with:**
- Mined genesis block (5.4 billion hashes, 7 hours)
- Zero DNS dependencies
- Complete P2P networking
- All services operational

### 1.1 Goals

1. **Permanent bootstrap viability** without DNS dependencies or trusted third-party domains
2. **Transparent founder vesting** with consensus-enforced, irreversible timelocks
3. **Incentivized relay network** with optional fee-sharing rewards for propagation quality
4. **Sybil-resistant peer discovery** hardened against botnet saturation
5. **Mobile-first architecture** with NiPoPoW-ready light clients from block 1
6. **On-chain notarization** layer for off-chain metadata commitments

**Status: All 6 goals achieved and operational.**

## 3. Consensus Mechanics

### 3.1 Proof-of-Work (SHA-256d)

Irium uses double SHA-256 hashing, identical to Bitcoin:

```
block_hash = SHA256(SHA256(header))
valid_block = block_hash < target
```

**Benefits:**
- 16+ years of battle-testing
- Compatible with Bitcoin mining hardware (ASICs, GPUs)
- Well-understood security properties
- Existing mining infrastructure

**Genesis Block:**
- Nonce: 1,110,943,221
- Hash: cbdd1b...000000 (valid mainnet PoW)
- Mined: October 16, 2025 after 5.4 billion hashes

### 3.2 Difficulty Adjustment

**Target:** 600 seconds per block (10 minutes)
**Retarget Interval:** Every 2016 blocks (~14 days)

**Algorithm:**
```python
expected_time = 2016 * 600  # 1,209,600 seconds
actual_time = last_block_time - first_block_time
new_difficulty = old_difficulty * (actual_time / expected_time)
```

Adjustments are clamped to prevent manipulation.

### 3.3 Block Validation

Each block must satisfy:
1. `block_hash < target` (proof-of-work)
2. Merkle root matches transaction tree
3. Timestamp within consensus range
4. All transactions valid (no double-spends)
5. Coinbase reward ≤ subsidy + fees
6. Block connects to valid chain tip

**Implementation:** irium/chain.py (_validate_block_header)

## 4. Economic Model

### 4.1 Supply Distribution

**Total Supply:** 100,000,000 IRM (hard cap)

**Genesis Vesting (3.5%):** 3,500,000 IRM
- 1,000,000 IRM unlocks at block 52,560 (~1 year)
- 1,250,000 IRM unlocks at block 105,120 (~2 years)
- 1,250,000 IRM unlocks at block 157,680 (~3 years)

**Mineable Supply (96.5%):** 96,500,000 IRM
- Distributed via block rewards
- Halves every 210,000 blocks
- Fair distribution through mining

### 4.2 Block Rewards Schedule

| Block Range | Reward | Blocks | Total IRM |
|-------------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 1 - 210,000 | 50 IRM | 210,000 | 10,500,000 |
| 210,001 - 420,000 | 25 IRM | 210,000 | 5,250,000 |
| 420,001 - 630,000 | 12.5 IRM | 210,000 | 2,625,000 |
| 630,001 - 840,000 | 6.25 IRM | 210,000 | 1,312,500 |
| ... | Continues halving | ... | ... |

**Total mineable:** 96,500,000 IRM over ~80 years

### 4.3 Transaction Fees

**Minimum Fee:** 0.0001 IRM (10,000 satoshis)

**Fee Distribution:**
- 90% to block miner
- 10% to relay nodes (up to 3 relays)
  - First relay: 50% of relay pool
  - Second relay: 30% of relay pool
  - Third relay: 20% of relay pool

**Comparison:**
- Bitcoin: ~0.001 BTC (~$30-50 USD)
- Irium: 0.0001 IRM (fraction of a cent)

Ultra-low fees enable micropayments and frequent transactions.

## 5. The 8 Core Innovations

### 5.1 Zero-DNS Bootstrap

**Problem:** DNS is centralized, censorable, and a single point of failure.

**Irium Solution:**
- Signed `seedlist.txt` with raw IP multiaddrs (IPv4 + IPv6)
- Signed `anchors.json` with checkpoint block headers
- Bootstrap script: `irium-zero.sh` (no DNS queries)
- Distributed via GitHub, IPFS, torrents
- Signature verification with secp256k1

**Status:** ✅ Implemented and operational

**Files:**
- `bootstrap/seedlist.txt` - Seed node IPs
- `bootstrap/anchors.json` - Chain checkpoints
- `scripts/irium-zero.sh` - Bootstrap script

### 5.2 Self-Healing Peer Discovery

**Problem:** Networks need stable, honest peers; centralized trackers create vulnerabilities.

**Irium Solution:**
- Uptime proof system (HMAC challenges)
- Peer reputation scoring (0-1000 scale)
- Automatic peer promotion/demotion
- Network 'remembers' reliable peers
- `seedlist.runtime` updated automatically

**Status:** ✅ Implemented (irium/uptime.py, irium/network.py)

**Reputation Factors:**
- Successful connections: +2 points each
- Failed connections: -5 points each
- Valid blocks shared: +10 points each
- Invalid blocks: -50 points each
- Uptime proofs: +5 points each

**Thresholds:**
- Trusted peer: Score > 80
- Banned peer: Score < 20

### 5.3 Genesis Vesting with On-chain CLTV

**Problem:** Founder allocations often lack transparency or enforcement.

**Irium Solution:**
- 3.5M IRM locked in genesis block
- 3 separate UTXOs with OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY
- Unlock heights: 52,560 / 105,120 / 157,680 blocks
- Consensus-enforced (cannot be spent early)
- Fully transparent in genesis.json
- Irreversible timelock

**Status:** ✅ Implemented in genesis block

**Genesis Allocations:**
```json
{
  "founder_vesting_1y": 1000000 IRM (52560 blocks)
  "founder_vesting_2y": 1250000 IRM (105120 blocks)
  "founder_vesting_3y": 1250000 IRM (157680 blocks)
}
```

### 5.4 Per-Transaction Relay Rewards

**Problem:** No incentive to run relay nodes; slow transaction propagation.

**Irium Solution:**
- Relay nodes earn 10% of transaction fees
- Up to 3 relays per transaction
- Distribution: 50%, 30%, 20%
- Included in coinbase transaction
- No supply inflation (comes from tx fees)

**Status:** ✅ Implemented (irium/relay.py)

**Example:**
- Transaction fee: 0.001 IRM
- Relay pool: 0.0001 IRM (10%)
- First relay earns: 0.00005 IRM (50%)
- Second relay earns: 0.00003 IRM (30%)
- Third relay earns: 0.00002 IRM (20%)
- Miner earns: 0.0009 IRM (90%)

### 5.5 Sybil-Resistant P2P Handshake

**Problem:** Botnets can saturate networks with fake peers.

**Irium Solution:**
- Proof-of-work challenge during handshake
- Ephemeral key signing
- Timestamp validation (5 minute window)
- Configurable difficulty (default: 8 bits)
- Trivial for legitimate nodes, prohibitive for bots

**Status:** ✅ Implemented (irium/sybil.py)

**Process:**
1. Node A sends PoW challenge to Node B
2. Node B solves challenge (8-bit PoW)
3. Node B returns proof with signature
4. Node A verifies proof and timestamp
5. Connection established if valid

### 5.6 Anchor-File Consensus

**Problem:** Eclipse attacks can feed new nodes false chains.

**Irium Solution:**
- Signed checkpoint headers (`anchors.json`)
- Multiple trusted signers
- New nodes verify chain against anchors
- Protects even if all peers are malicious

**Status:** ✅ Implemented (irium/anchors.py)

**Anchor Structure:**
```json
{
  "height": 0,
  "hash": "cbdd1b913...",
  "timestamp": 1735689601,
  "signatures": ["..."]
}
```

### 5.7 Light Client First (SPV + NiPoPoW)

**Problem:** Mobile devices can't store full blockchain.

**Irium Solution:**
- SPV (Simplified Payment Verification)
- NiPoPoW (Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work)
- Header-only sync
- Merkle proof verification
- Superblock proofs for ultra-light clients

**Status:** ✅ Implemented (irium/spv.py)

**Light Client Benefits:**
- Download only headers (~80 bytes per block)
- Verify transactions with merkle proofs
- NiPoPoW: Logarithmic proof size
- Mobile wallet ready

### 5.8 On-chain Metadata Commitments

**Problem:** No native way to timestamp documents.

**Irium Solution:**
- Coinbase metadata field
- Hash pointers to off-chain data
- Notarization layer
- Immutable timestamp proofs

**Status:** ✅ Structure ready, integrated

**Use Cases:**
- Document timestamping
- Code release verification
